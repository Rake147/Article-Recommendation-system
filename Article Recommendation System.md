## As you can see from the output above, a new column has been added to the dataset that contains the titles of all the recommended articles. Now letâ€™s see all the recommendations for an article


```python
print(data["Recommended Articles"][2])
```

    Language Detection with Machine Learning, Apple Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning, Multiclass Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning, News Classification with Machine Learning
